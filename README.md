## Case Studies
we have experimented with two Teacher models on the SYN dataset with 2% labeling, as described below. We found that the values computed at each step exactly match the intuition of the method. We describe these case studies below.

In this experiment, we have access to two Teachers. Teacher 1 (T1) specializes in Classes A, B, C, and D while Teacher 2 (T2) specializes in Classes C, D, E, and F. Their expertise overlaps only on Classes C and D.

First, we showcase the Teacher Trust Learner (TTL) overcoming an overconfident teacher via an example from Class E, on which only T2 is an expert. T1 predicts P(y_j | y_j \in Y_k, X) = [0, 0, .99, 0, 0, 0] (confidently-wrong prediction of Class C), while T2 predicts [0, 0, 0, 0, .99, 0] (confidently-correct prediction of Class E). Then, the TTL predicts P(y_j \in Y_k∣X) = [.27,.73], indicating that T2 should be trusted more than T1 (correctly). Finally, rescaling via P(y_j ∣y_j \in Y_k, X)P(y_j \in Y_k∣X) and combining the teachers’ predictions: .27[0, 0, .99, 0, 0,0] + .73[0, 0, 0, 0, .99, 0] = [0, 0, .27, 0, .72, 0], which serves as the surrogate target for the student network. This example clearly shows the TTL overcoming an overconfident teacher (T1) to provide a good surrogate target.

Second, we showcase the TTL effectively preserving accurate predictions for an instance for which both Teachers are experts. On an instance from Class D, T1 predicts P(y_j | y_j \in Y_k, X) = [0, 0, 0, .99, 0, 0] (correct), while T2 also predicts [0, 0, 0, .99, 0, 0] (correct). Then, the TTL predicts P(y_j \in Y_k∣X) = [.5, .5], indicating the teachers should be trusted equally (correct). Finally, rescaling and combining the teachers’ predictions we have the perfect surrogate label: [0, 0, 0, .99, 0, 0].

Third, we showcase an instance from Class A, where Teacher 1 is an expert but Teacher 2 is neither an expert nor confident. T1 predicts P(y_j | y_j \in Y_k, X) = [.99, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (correct), while T2 predicts [0, 0, .63, .02, 0, .34] (incorrect). Then, the TTL predicts P(y_j \in Y_k∣X) = [.72, .28], indicating that T1 should be trusted more than T2 (correctly). Finally, the surrogate label after rescaling and combining the teachers’ predictions is [.71, 0, .18, .01,. 10] leading the student model to the right direction.
